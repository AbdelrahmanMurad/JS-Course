* Loosely Typed vs Strongly Typed
    Part 1. Loosely Typed Language:
        A loosely typed language is a programming language that does not require a variable to be defined.
        For example, Perl,js is a loosely typed language, you can declare a variable, 
        but it doesn't require you to classify the type of variable.
                *Is JavaScript is a loosely typed language?
                JavaScript is loosely typed.
                You don't have to tell that a string is a string,
                nor you can require a function to accepts an integer as its parameter.
                This gives JavaScript a lot of flexibility.

    Part 2. Strongly Typed Language:
        A strongly typed language is a programming language that does require a variable to be defined.
        For example, Python,Java is a strongly typed language,
        you can't declare a variable without classifying the type of variable.
